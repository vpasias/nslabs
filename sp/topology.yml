  The devices under test are VLAN-to-VXLAN bridges between two access VLANs
  and two VXLAN VNIs.

  * h1 and h2 should be able to ping each other
  * h3 and h4 should be able to ping each other
  * h1 should not be able to reach h3

  Please note it might take a while for the lab to work due to
  STP learning phase
